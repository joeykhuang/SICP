**generic operations with explicit dispatch:**
- modify existing operations to account for new data types
- adding new operations for each data type-tag

**data-directed style:**
- define explicit operations in each data type
- can have different operations / structure for each data type
- do not need to change existing system

**message-passing style:**
- define new data types using existing operations
- does not have extra code besides each data type

**new types added:** message-passing style is best
**new operations added:** data-directed style is best
